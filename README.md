## Aim
- To comprehensively identify DROSHA-dependent human pri-miRNAs
- To map DROSHA cleavage sites

## Codes
- Snakefiles are to process and align the raw sequence files
- Table_s#.ipynb are to generate data tables
- Figure_#.ipynb are to draw figures

## Resources
- miRBase human pri-miRNA hairpins and their genome coodinates
- MirGeneDB human pri-miRNAs
- Supplementary tables that were used in the analysis
