# The Atlas 
The atlas of DROSHA cleavage types and cleavage sites for all human miRNAs

## Aim
- To define DROSHA cleavage types for human miRNAs
- To map DROSHA cleavage sites for human miRNAs
- To compare DROSHA cleavage types and sites between in vitro and in vivo
- To find cellular regulations on DROSHA processing

## Descriptions
- All sequencing data and mass-spectrometry data were generated by Kijun Kim
- We used supplementary tables from Kim et al. (2016) "Genome-wide Mapping of DROSHA Cleavage Sites on Primary MicroRNAs and Noncanonical Substrates" and Kim et al. (2016) "Re-evaluation of the roles of DROSHA, Export in 5, and DICER in microRNA biogenesis.
